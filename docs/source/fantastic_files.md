# Fantastic Files And Where To Find Them

This page describes the list of files generated from openlane, their sources, and their expected benefits.

The files are listed by category to ease the process of looking specific functions up.

**NOTE:** Files prefixed with `X-` will appear in the run directory prefixed with a step index, i.e. `12-` which indicates that this file was generated during step 12 of the flow.

**NOTE:** All listed locations are under `<run_path>` for a given run.

## Summary Reports

| File     | Stage     | Location     | Description                                           |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `final_summary_report.csv`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes a summary of important design metrics, statistics, and configurations that are useful to observe and keep track of. The description for each column is documented [here][0]. |
| `manufacturability_report.rpt`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes a summary of the manufacturability metrics: DRC, LVS, and Antenna violations. |
| `runtime_summary_report.rpt`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes an aggregated summary of the runtime for each step of the flow shown in the `-h-m-s-ms` format. |
| `runtime_summary_report.rpt.parsable`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes an aggregated summary of the runtime for each step of the flow shown in a parser friendly format, recorded in seconds. |
| `total_runtime.txt`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes the flow status followed by the total runtime. |
| `routed_runtime.txt`   | `Flow Completion Or Failure` | `reports/` | Includes the routing status followed by the total runtime up to routing completion. |

## DRC

| File     | Stage     | Location     | Description                                           |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `X-tritonRoute.drc`   | `Detailed Routing` | `reports/routing/` | Includes the DRC report generated by the tritonRoute internal DRC engine after completing detailed routing. The report includes the type, the coordinates in the DEF/GDS, and the source nets for that violation. |
| `X-tritonRoute.klayout.xml`   | `Detailed Routing` | `reports/routing` | Includes the DRC report generated by the tritonRoute internal DRC engine after completing detailed routing in an XML klayout marker database format to be loadable into klayout. |
| `X-magic.drc`   | `Magic - DRC` | `reports/magic` | Includes the DRC report generated by magic's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This can be generated from a run on either DEF or GDS based on the value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`. |
| `X-magic.drc.klayout.xml`   | `Magic - DRC` | `reports/magic` | Includes the DRC report generated by magic's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in XML klayout marker database format to be loadable into klayout. This can be generated from a run on either DEF or GDS based on the value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`. |
| `X-magic.drc.rdb`   | `Magic - DRC` | `reports/magic` | Includes the DRC report generated by magic's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in RDB format to be loadable by Calibre. This can be generated from a run on either DEF or GDS based on the value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`. |
| `X-magic.drc.tcl`   | `Magic - DRC` | `reports/magic` | Includes the DRC report generated by magic's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in magic TCL format to be loadable by magic. This can be generated from a run on either DEF or GDS based on the value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`. |
| `X-magic.tr.drc`   | `Magic - DRC` | `reports/magic` | Includes the DRC report generated by magic's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in TritonRoute DRC engine format. This can be generated from a run on either DEF or GDS based on the value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`. |
| `X-klayout.magic.lydrc`   | `Klayout - DRC` | `reports/klayout` | Includes the DRC report generated by klayout's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in Klayout Marker Database Format. The `magic` part indicates that this report was generated from running DRC on the GDS-II generated by `magic`. |
| `X-klayout.klayout.lydrc`   | `Klayout - DRC` | `reports/klayout` | Includes the DRC report generated by klayout's DRC engine after streaming out the GDS. This file is in Klayout Marker Database Format. The `.klayout.` part indicates that this report was generated from running DRC on the GDS-II generated by `klayout`. |
| `X-magic.drc.log`   | `Magic - DRC` | `logs/magic` | The log for running `magic` DRC on the design. |
| `X-klayout.magic.drc.log` | `Klayout - DRC` | `logs/klayout` | The log for running `klayout` DRC on the design. The `magic` part indicates that this report was generated from running DRC on the GDS-II generated by `magic`. |
| `X-klayout.klayout.drc.log` | `Klayout - DRC` | `logs/klayout` | The log for running `klayout` DRC on the design. The `.klayout.` part indicates that this report was generated from running DRC on the GDS-II generated by `klayout`. |
